Simple web interface for my mp3 collection.

A simple combination of Sinatra and Soundmanager2 for personal use. Refer to 
those two projects if you want to see where the real heavy lifting occurs.

I was never happy with the speed of rendering large folders with Apache::MP3 and
the like, and I refuse to split my collection into A-M, N-Z, etc as I have seen
many people do.
