This project aims to be a simple, fast web interface for my mp3 collection.

Started because I was never happy with the speed of rendering large folders 
with Apache::MP3 and the like, and I refuse to accept any of the workarounds 
that I have seen. (i.e.: splitting the full collection into smaller categories, 
excessive database caching, etc)

Built on the shoulders of Sinatra and Soundmanager2. Refer to those two projects
if you want to see where the real heavy lifting occurs. I just assembled the 
puzzle pieces.
